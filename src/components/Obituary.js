                After growing up in Hitchcock, Texas, in Galveston County, Frosty studied Sociology and graduated from
                Sam Houston State University in 1961. He worked a variety of jobs before finding his calling as a Piping
                Design Engineer, which gave him many opportunities, including the ability to travel abroad and live in
                the U.S. Virgin Islands.

                Aside from his career in engineering, Frosty was passionate about sailing and photography. He often
                combined the two interests at sailboat regattas, where he both raced and documented the events in film.

                Frosty is survived by his children, Todd Davis and Meredith Davis, who he was deeply proud of, and his
                younger siblings, Bob Davis, Jack Davis, Jeanne Whittington, and Windi Compton. He was predeceased by
                his parents, Wilburn George “Pop” Davis Sr. and Dagny Marie Davis, and his pet Schnauzer, Luger, who was
                his best friend and companion.

                Frosty’s last wish was to be cremated and returned to Galveston Bay, a place that was dear to his heart.
